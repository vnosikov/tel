TODO & KNOWN ISSUES

1) Sometimes text editing can lead to error, which doesn't have any visible consequences - need to check if it reproduces now
2) If text content block is extremely small, element resizing can move it outside of a box - maybe also happens with small images
3) Need to make possible z-axis movement
4) It will be nice to have a feature of changing block's color
5) Templates in the list on the left have to be aligned, their contents should be centered
8) Polymorph code in content.js is simply very bad
9) Template list should be scrollable
10) Global variable in element.js
