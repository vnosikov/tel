TODO & KNOWN ISSUES

1) Sometimes text editing can lead to error, which doesn't have any visible consequences - need to check if it reproduces now
2) If text content block is extremely small, element resizing can move it outside of a box - maybe also happens with small images
3) Need to make possible z-axis movement
4) It will be nice to have a feature of changing block's color
8) Polymorph code in content.js [is simply very bad] is much better but still can be improved
9) Template list should be scrollable
10) Global variable in element.js
